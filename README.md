# RS-VFMs-Fine-tuning-Dataset
This dataset is specifically designed for fine-tuning the VFMs. The dataset contains 42,000 images with varying dimensions (256×256, 200×200, and 400×400 pixels) and resolutions ranging from 0.3 meters to 2 meters. It covers 70 common land cover classes in RS. Each image was annotated with a corresponding textual description to create the RS VFMs Fine-tuning Dataset. This dataset encompasses 70 common land cover classes, such as farmland, cloud, residential, desert, forest, freeway, harbor, industrial area, island, mountain, railway, and river. 

This dataset will be open sourced after the paper is accepted.
