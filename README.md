# RS-VFMs-Fine-tuning-Dataset
This dataset is specifically designed for fine-tuning the VFMs. The dataset contains 42,000 images with varying dimensions (256×256, 200×200, and 400×400 pixels) and resolutions ranging from 0.3 meters to 2 meters. It covers 70 common land cover classes in RS. This dataset will be open sourced after the paper is accepted.
After the article is published, we will upload our code here.
